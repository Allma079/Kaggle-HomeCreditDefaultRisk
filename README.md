# Kaggle-Home Credit Default Risk Competition

The [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) has all the details about the data and some very interesting kernels that do some data analysis.

Our team for the Competition had as team members : [Me](https://www.kaggle.com/maximeallard) and [KÃ©isecker](https://www.kaggle.com/maximek3). We both contributed to the solution presented in this repository.

This is our team's solution for the Home Credit Default Risk Competition hosted on Kaggle which earned a bronze medal. The Kernel that was of a big help was from Will Koehrsen. The Kernel can be found here :https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/clean-manual-feature-engineering. 

There are two parts: One is the solution which was used for the bronze medal and the other one is a stacked model which has not been used because the competition was over.
